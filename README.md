# Sentiment Analysis experiments using brazilian portuguese tweets

This repository contains studies and experiments performed using brazilian portuguese tweets.

The main dataset is [TweetSentBR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08917), which can be recreated based on instructions 
available at [this repository](https://bitbucket.org/HBrum/tweetsentbr/src/master/). As the first goal of this 
project was to reproduce the achievements reported on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08917), part of the code 
was also reused (e.g., emoticon, emoji, negative words and words polarities definitions).
